# Income Tax Filing form
Create an Income Tax Filing form by using Microsoft Excel

## Introduction
I created an Income Tax Filing form by using Microsoft Excel.
It requires the user to enter their **Total Gross Income**, and then choose/enter the **Tax Relief Items**.
After that, the form will automatically do all the calculations and show the **Total Tax Paid** and **Net Income after Tax** for the user.
