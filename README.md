# Income Tax Filing form
Develop an **Income Tax Filing** form by using **Microsoft Excel**

## Introduction
I developed an Income Tax Filing form using Microsoft Excel, streamlining the tax calculation process. Users input their **Total Gross Income** and select/enter applicable **Tax Relief Items**, allowing the form to automate comprehensive calculations. This provides users with a clear breakdown of Total Tax Paid and Net Income after Tax.

### Notice
This form utilizes VBA, making it a macro-enabled Excel file.
