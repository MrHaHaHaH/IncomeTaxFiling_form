# Income Tax Filing form
Create an Income Tax Filing form by using Microsoft Excel

## Introduction
I created an Income Tax Filing form by using Microsoft Excel. It requires a user to enter his/her **Total Gross Income**, and then choose/enter the **Tax Relief Items**. After that, the form will automatically do all the calculations and show the **Total Tax Paid** and **Net Income after Tax** for the user.  

### Notice
As I have used the VBA in this form, this is a macro-enabled Excel file.
